## Basics
The `<interact-multi-select>` wrapper is used twice along with its `<interact-multi-select-option>` in a form.
The demo-app is running an example for a complex object type and for a native number type.
You can:
 * change the select label with the associated input above each form field
 * change the form state to 'DISABLED'/'ENABLED'
 * see how the form validation is handed down to the library component thanks to the SUBMIT button state
 * test the multi-select component to your heart's content
